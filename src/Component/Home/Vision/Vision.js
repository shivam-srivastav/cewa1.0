                In a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion, 1/3rd
                of them starve for their daily bread and hold the largest share
                of the world’s extreme poor.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                Additionally, India records a burgeon in malnutrition cases
                despite the booming economy as per the authorities.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to fiscal needs or any supplementary reason, 3.9% of the
                total child population are working as main workers.{" "}
              </li>
              <li>
                Intertwined to child labor, more than 42.7 million children in
                India are out of school, further abating the literacy rate.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There’s no doubt that India’s at-risk children from the lower
              sections are to be rescued from these chains, holding them back
              from a promising future. This is what motivates us to further
              spread our reach and bestow our serviceability. We yearn for a
              more influential society free from all forms of exploitation and
              discrimination, where everyone has equal opportunities to perceive
              their potential.
